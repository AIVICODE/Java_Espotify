As a team, we developed a management system in Java, which included both a desktop application and a web interface. We implemented Web Services to enable seamless communication between platforms. The web interface was built using technologies like JavaScript and Bootstrap, resulting in a dynamic and functional design that allowed real-time data management. This project enhanced our skills in backend and frontend development, as well as teamwork.
